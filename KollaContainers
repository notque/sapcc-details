We use Kolla Containers to build some pieces of openstack (at least designate).

In kolla, any python module that needs to be installed comes in via a "plugin": E.g.

For the Pike build, it was missing several python modules I needed. I had to add them to the build.

You can choose in which layer it should be installed by the convention `[<image-name>-plugin-<plugin-name>]`

Since we want the audit-middleware in all our apps, we add as a openstack-base-plugin, like the "openstack-ops-middleware"
