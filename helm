Helm Diff: 
  A helm plugin that shows a diff explaining what a helm upgrade would change
  https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff
  Syntax:
    helm diff designate(name of chart) designate(name of helm charts dir) -f staging/values/designate.yaml(location of secrets value file)
    
Helm Dependencies:
  https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/helm/helm_dependency.md
  https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/charts.md
  We use them frequently
  helm dependency update (helm dep up) in the dir for the charts
  Dependencies are located in requirements.yaml
  
  These dependencies are other charts that we want. For example, if we wish to include a section from another chart, we have to add it as a dependency

Helm Define ClustterF: 
  If you are in a large helm system, you may run into people Defining the same keywords in multiple charts.
  If you use multiple charts as dependencies, you cannot ensure which define you get. It will propegate all calls.
  Ordering the dependency list does not help.

Deployment - Image -> Helm Charts -> 
  Designate pipeline is not taking care of building the image. It is done via kolla build
