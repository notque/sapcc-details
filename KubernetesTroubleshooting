When you try to drain a Kubernetes node but it blocks ?

This is not a story. Is more a reminder to myself, to remember what to do when I try to drain a Kubernetes node, but it blocks.

So I start by trying to drain the node :

> kubectl drain <node_name> [--ignore-daemonsets --force --delete-local-data]

node "<node_name>" cordoned
pod "pod-xxx" evicted
pod "pod-yyy" evicted
pod "pod-zzz" evicted

then it blocks after have evicted the pod-zzz,

if you try to find the pod-zzz you ‘ll see that the pod does not exist anymore , that’s normal it was evicted, so it was not the blocking pod. So we need to find the blocking pod.

For that I will search all the pods of the node (on a new console)

> kubectl get pods -o wide --all-namespaces | grep <node_name>

namespace  my-blocking-pod  0/1  Terminating n xh <none> <node_name>

Once I have the name of the guilty one :

> kubectl delete pod <pod_name> -n=<namespace> --grace-period=0 --force

Once it’s done you are going to see that the console with the drain running will continue.

You can after restart your node (if you are connected to the node):

> systemctl restart kubelet
> systemctl status kubelet 

Active: active (running) since .....

and uncordon your node, if you don’t have other maintenance to do :

> kubectl uncordon <node_name
